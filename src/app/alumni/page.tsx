        bio={`I grew up in Cleveland, MS (home of the Fighting Okra, yes look it up). I attended Mississippi State University for my undergraduate degree in Biological 
        Sciences and Mississippi College for my master's degree in Biomedical Sciences. I have worked for the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) as a 
        researcher for 7 years studying adolescent pediatric scoliosis in the pediatric population before returning to Mississippi State University for my doctorate 
        degree in molecular biology and biochemistry. I worked for the USDA-ARS as a post-doctoral f ellow for 3 years as a geneticist prior to joining Dr. Yarar-Fisher's 
        team where I am the laboratory manager and a researcher. Dr. Yarar-Fisher's program investigating spinal cord injury compliments some techniques that I have learned 
        along my academic and professional career but, most importantly, has encompassed many new and exciting disciplines and techniques including bioinformatics, 
        tissue culture, RNAseq, metabolic profiling, immunohistochemistry, and other procedures to study individuals with SCI. As a researcher, I contribute to running 
        experiments, data analysis and writing and editing of manuscripts. My laboratory manager duties include keeping the laboratory safe and legal, reconciliation of 
        accounts, and mentorship and training of physicians and medical, physical therapy, undergraduate, and high school students in the laboratory. Some of my interests 
        outside of the lab include playing sports, hanging out with family and friends, home improvement, traveling domestically to explore different cities along with 
        their food and culture, tailgating, and relaxing.`}

        bio={`I am a 4th year post-doctoral scholar at Rehabilitation Medicine Laboratory. I am from China, and I earned my master's degree in Molecular Genetics 
        from the University of Cincinnati and my PhD degree in Nutrition Sciences from Purdue University. During my PhD training, I was involved with clinical trials 
        investigating several aspects of dietary components on metabolic health outcomes. I greatly appreciated the applicability of human clinical nutrition research. 
        In the meanwhile, I became interested in exploring the underlying mechanisms for the development of cardio-metabolic diseases. I joined Dr. Yarar-Fisher's lab 
        in 2017 to further expand my training in nutrition research and gain additional skillset in microbiome and metabolomics analyses. My current research projects 
        include: 1) investigating the effects of a high-protein/low-carbohydrate diet on body composition, metabolic health, and gut microbiome in patients with 
        long-standing spinal cord injury and 2) understanding the relationship between gut microbiome and glucose control in individuals with SCI supported by the
         NIDILRR Mary Switzer Research fellowship and Craig Nielsen Foundation postdoctoral fellowship. I love spending time with my family, cooking cuisines from across 
         the world, and traveling.`}

        title="Summer Medical Student"
        image="/headshots/Perry-headshot.jpg"
        bio={`As a medical student just completing their first year, I chose to pursue research over the 2017 summer to increase the breadth of my research experience to include 
        working with patients in a clinical setting and pursuing answers to questions that may later impact patient care and recovery. I was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama 
        and graduated with a B.S. in Kinesiology from The University of Alabama at Birmingham. My college career began nontraditionally at the age of 27 after working as a personal 
        fitness trainer. I felt led to pursue higher education as I realized my passions were with caring for and educating others in areas of health and well-being. Ultimately, 
        I felt the call of medicine and began attending The University of Alabama School of Medicine in late 2016. My first research experience was during my undergraduate career 
        under Dr. Gordon Fisher, where I performed immunohistochemistry to determine muscle fiber type ratios in participants before and after interventional exercise programs 
        and performed cross-sectional analysis comparing vital measurements such as blood pressure, arterial elasticity, and insulin sensitivity. I became much more familiar with 
        principles and pathways for which I was already passionate, while also being able to see how these phenotypic differences may affect health outcomes and risk in certain 
        patient populations. My limited experiences have led me to believe that a career in physical medicine and rehabilitation would be exceptionally rewarding and I was 
        fortunate enough to be selected to receive the Summer Research Fellowship Award from the Diabetes Research Center. This opportunity involves conducting research under the 
        guidance of Dr. Yarar-Fisher, as it relates to patients with spinal cord injuries and the examination of novel nutritional modalities and their effects on protection and 
        recovery from damage, as well as brown adipose tissue distribution, functionality, and activity. Personally observing how dramatically a patient's mobility can be altered 
        by a single event and then being able to explore questions and seek answers that may lead to improvements in such patients' quality of life is a reward without parallel.`}

        bio={`I am a medical student about to start my second year here at the University of Alabama School of Medicine (UASOM). Born and brought up in Birmingham, I headed to 
        Nashville, Tennessee for a change in scenery to attend Vanderbilt University for my undergraduate studies, earning a degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology. After 
        gaining some perspective on basic science research during my time in college, I was curious to expand my horizons in the realm of research and try clinical or translational 
        research. As a medical student, I wanted to enter an area of research that greatly interests me as well as an area that I could possibly see myself pursuing as a career. 
        Taking neuroscience courses as an undergraduate gave me immense enthusiasm for medicine involving the nervous system and played a significant role in my decision to join 
        Dr. Yarar-Fisher's lab. Through the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Functional Neurorehabilitation Research Program, I received the FNR Scholarship 
        award to do research this summer. My research will be investigating the effectiveness of a ketogenic diet in facilitating neuro-recovery following spinal cord injury 
        (SCI). We believe processes that typically occur after SCI, such as glutamate excitotoxity, inflammation, and induction of apoptotic pathways, will be inhibited by 
        ketone bodies resulting from a ketogenic diet. Our hypothesis is that 8 weeks of a ketogenic diet, as compared to a standard diet, immediately following SCI significantly 
        improves motor and sensory function as well as functional independence in patients with complete SCI.`}

        bio={`I am a graduate student in the Department of Nutrition Science rotating in Dr. Yarar-Fisher's lab. I grew up in Miami, Florida, and attended Appalachian State 
        University in Boone, NC earning my B.S. in Nutrition and Foods, and Exercise Science as well as my M.S. in Dietetics. I am incredibly excited and appreciative for the 
        opportunity to work in Dr. Yarar-Fisher's lab. Rehabilitation Medicine is an area of research that has always interested me, but I have previously not had the opportunity 
        to be exposed to. As a lifelong competitive athlete, I am interested in examining the differences both small and large between injured and trained muscle. Along with 
        differences in how injured vs. trained muscle responds to nutrition. Gaining a better understanding of these intricate differences could lead to novel and improved nutrition 
        and exercise intervention strategies for those with injury. Outside of school, my interests include running, hiking, cycling, cooking, traveling and hanging out with my 
        French Bulldog, Django.`}
