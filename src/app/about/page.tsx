      <p>
        The Pro-SCI Lab at Ohio University studies the pathophysiology of
        traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) in the acute and chronic stages, with
        the purpose of developing novel nutritional and rehabilitation
        strategies to improve neurorecovery, metabolic function, and microbiome
        composition. We do this by addressing exciting questions like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Can the ketogenic diet improve neurorecovery by decreasing
          neuroinflammation in the acute stages of SCI?
        </li>
        <li>
          How does a low-carbohydrate/high-protein diet impact insulin
          sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and muscle signaling for glucose
          utilization in the chronic stages of SCI?
        </li>
        <li>
          Can neuromuscular electrical stimulation help maintain healthy
          skeletal muscle size and fiber phenotype (homogenous distribution of
          Type I, IIa, and IIx fibers) early after SCI?
        </li>
        <li>
          How does SCI-induced distorted gut microbiome composition impact
          metabolic and bowel health outcomes after SCI?
        </li>
        <li>
          Can we identify therapeutic targets such as diet, probiotics,
          prebiotics, synbiotics, or fecal microbiome transplants to prevent
          secondary health complications of SCI?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We integrate SCI demographics, clinical and experimental data,
        metagenomics, and metabolomics into a comprehensive database to
        facilitate more complete health pictures, thus allowing the best
        treatment and prevention strategies for the acute and chronic stages of
        SCI.

        This kind of work is impactful and fun and all possible because of our
        diverse group of scientists (with backgrounds in neuroscience,
        rehabilitation, nutrition, skeletal muscle biology, metabolism, exercise
        science, microbiology, and biostatistics) working together. We inspire
        each other by freely sharing our data, expertise, and, most importantly,
        ideas.

        Dr. Yarar-Fisher is the principal investigator of the Pro-SCI Lab. She
        strives to ensure that all mentees, including under-represented racial
        and ethnic minorities and international students, feel supported in
        their quest for a satisfying and successful career and confident in
        their skills and contributions. Her mentoring style is
        empowerment-oriented, culturally sensitive, and excellence-driven. She
        aims to provide unconditional supportive mentoring, whether her trainees
        want to become researchers like her. She encourages their independence
        by introducing them to many resources to help them thrive independently
        when she is not around. She encourages them to take an active role in
        designing, planning, and executing experiments and interpreting results.
        By the end of the training, her trainees can design, execute,
        troubleshoot the experiments, and interpret the findings.
      </p>

        She has intentionally created a space within her laboratory that
        harnesses their collective interests to build a strong team with a
        common goal of contributing discoveries in SCI and improving the quality
        of life for those impacted by the injury while recognizing and
        celebrating their diverse backgrounds and identities. Pro-SCI lab
        members believe science works best to produce novel insights when
        influenced by diverse ideas from individuals working together.

        We are located in the fantastic city of Columbus, OH (Go Buckeyes!) with
        innovative arts scenes and booming tech industry.

        Until a few months ago we were located at Birmingham, AL (Magic City!)-
        only place in the world where all three raw ingredients for steel (coal,
        limestone, and iron ore) occur naturally within a ten-mile radius.
